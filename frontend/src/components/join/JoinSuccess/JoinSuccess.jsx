              <p>
                The best way to be a part of the community is to join the club's
                Discord community! Discord is a free text, voice, and video chat
                app that allows members of the community to talk with each other
                in multiple channels, keeping each conversation on topic unlike
                traditional instant messaging apps.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have separate text channels where members can request help
                with their code, find others to team up with, get advice about
                their careers, and much more. If you've ever used Slack before,
                you can think of Discord as a casual version of Slack! Discord
                can be accessed through your computer, web browser, or mobile
                device.
              </p>

              <p>
                Not sure how to use Discord and/or never used it before? Don't
                worry, Discord has you covered! You can find a beginner's guide
