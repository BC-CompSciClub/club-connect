        We&apos;ve got some awesome events planned for our club members once the
        semester starts! Check back here around mid-August for more details.
        We&apos;ll be notifying our club members in our monthly newsletter once
        the events are up. Make sure to join the club before then so you
        don&apos;t miss out! See you at an event soon!
